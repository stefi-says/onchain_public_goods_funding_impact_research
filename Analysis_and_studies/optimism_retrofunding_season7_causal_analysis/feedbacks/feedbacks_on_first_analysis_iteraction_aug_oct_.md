## stakeholder from Optimism Retro Funding rounds

- This and the previous rounds with on-chain builders theme were not considered successful, the impact was not visible on the success metrics. 

- They think the program structure is not proper to be able to identify if the incentives have changed the builders' intention on building and possibly getting the rewards. They think the structure should make the builders sign for the rounds (kind of a virtual incubator), build and then get funding (but other people say this is not sustainable as the risk stays all with the builder) 
- They said that the TVL growht was not visible for the Onchain builders and that they will go back to focus on the OSS and dev tooling .
- they have TVL as a north star metric but I asked how they measure internally a successful round. They said they talk with the funds receiver to check their reaction to the funds. Small projects are reactive to funds. 
- they said from top of mind that their 45 top projects are the ones that move the needle on TVL but are not reactive to funding.  
- they think the idea of analyzing and understanding the step function of how much a project needs to take their only developer to be full-time developer is interesting. 
- metrics based funding may not continue in the close future 
- interesting paths in their opinion: 
	- better understanding of the Open source projects to funding. 
		- the step function  funding reaction 
- Probably they will leave TVL growth under the responsibility of the growth grants. 
- Would like to understand the monopoly of use cases on WEB3 example of the Etherscan vs Blockscout where Blockscout was financed throughout the rounds until it became an Etherscan competitor, breaking Etherscan's monopoly on data hosting and block explorer. 

## Optimism Grants Stakeholder

- The report was received positively and described as interesting and well-written.
- The stakeholder didn’t have direct feedback on methodology but expressed curiosity about expanding the scope to **grants analysis**, which might be easier to measure than retroactive funding.

### Suggestion: Analyze Grants Programs

- It was suggested to explore **grants from Seasons 7 and 8**, as those focused on **incentive and audit programs**.
- The stakeholder mentioned ongoing discussions about how to measure **TVL growth attribution** when multiple incentive programs overlap — particularly whether the Foundation allocated impact by total funding or by fixed percentages.
- They noted that **retroactive funding** is less straightforward to evaluate since outcomes are not expected after the funding distribution.

### Discussion on Methodological Challenges

- Acknowledged that causal analysis in this context is difficult due to the number of **external and internal variables** that can affect outcomes (e.g., timing, deployment strategy, external market conditions).
- Concluded that results might remain **inconclusive** without sufficient control over these variables.
- Reflected that the current analysis might have a **design limitation**, prompting exploration of new analytical directions.

###  Future Directions

 A new idea emerged to investigate **monopolies within the ecosystem**, inspired by the example of **Etherscan vs. Blockscout**, where funding helped create competition.
 Next step involves assessing **data availability** to determine whether such an analysis is feasible or if a different research path should be pursued.


### Open Source Observer 
- They were interested in the techniques applied to analyze the data 
- They were already thinking about implementing causal analysis in production as a way for the grants system to follow a set of funded projects versus another group of projects in other ecosystems as a control 
- They noted that retro funding rounds are scaling down but this framework could be applied to other grant rounds as well

### Collaboration Interest

- The stakeholder expressed interest in collaborating on a potential **grants-related analysis**, viewing it as a valuable learning opportunity.
