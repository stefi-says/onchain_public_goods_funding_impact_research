# Onchain Public Goods Funding Impact Research 

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the **research and development** of a project that aims to **map the current state of the public goods ecosystem** and contribute with possible enhancements to make it more effective and sustainable.

### My Goal

This research initially focused on impact analysis methodologies for **RetroPGF (Retroactive Public Goods Funding)**, but has subsequently expanded to examine comprehensive impact evaluation frameworks across the Web3 ecosystem. The primary objective is to develop methodologically rigorous systems characterized by automation, transparency, cost-effectiveness, and data-driven metrics for quantifying contributions. Such frameworks would enable Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and projects to implement evidence-based compensation mechanisms for open-source contributors. While acknowledging the inherent limitations in quantifying certain impact domains, this work identifies substantial opportunities for enhancing current evaluation methodologies.

### 📊 Published Analyses

#### Measuring On-Chain Impact of RetroPGF Season 7
An exploratory causal analysis examining whether Optimism's RetroPGF Season 7 funding caused measurable increases in on-chain transaction activity for top-funded DEX projects (Uniswap, Aerodrome, Velodrome).

**Status:** 🚧 Ongoing - Currently collecting feedback

**Key Findings:**
- Applied Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models to detect causal impact
- No statistically significant effects detected (p-values: 0.20-0.36)
- Results highlight methodological challenges and data requirements for impact measurement in crypto
- All code, data, and methodology shared openly for community learning
